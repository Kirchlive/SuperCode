# Documentation Usage Rules

## üìñ Documentation Usage Guide

### Documentation Reference Matrix

| Purpose | Primary File | Secondary Files | Update Frequency | When to Consult |
|---------|-------------|-----------------|------------------|-----------------|
| **Current State** | STATUS.md | CHANGELOG.md | After each task | Starting work, checking blockers |
| **Planning** | PLANNING.md | STATUS.md | Weekly/Phase end | Finding next task, timeline check |
| **Technical Design** | ARCHITECTURE.md | FEATURE-MAPPING.md | On design changes | Before coding, design decisions |
| **Setup & Usage** | SETUP.md | README.md | On env changes | Initial setup, tool updates |
| **Project Overview** | README.md | CLAUDE.md | Rarely | New to project, major updates |

üí° **Efficiency Note**: Only read files that are not already in your current context. Re-reading files wastes tokens and time. Trust your existing knowledge unless explicitly asked to refresh or when the file has been modified.

### Documentation Update Workflow

#### Update Priority Order
1. **STATUS.md** - Always update first (metrics, issues, progress)
2. **CHANGELOG.md** - Immediately after STATUS (chronological record)
3. **Other files** - As affected by changes

#### Specific Update Scenarios

| Scenario | Required Updates | Optional Updates | Timing |
|----------|-----------------|------------------|---------|
| **Task Completed** | STATUS.md, CHANGELOG.md | PLANNING.md (if milestone) | Immediately |
| **Bug Fixed** | STATUS.md (remove issue), CHANGELOG.md | ARCHITECTURE.md (if design affected) | Before commit |
| **Feature Added** | STATUS.md, CHANGELOG.md, FEATURE-MAPPING.md | ARCHITECTURE.md, README.md | After testing |
| **Design Change** | ARCHITECTURE.md, CHANGELOG.md | FEATURE-MAPPING.md, STATUS.md | Before implementation |
| **Phase Complete** | All affected docs | Archive outdated content | End of week/phase |

#### Update Exceptions (When NOT to Update)
- ‚ùå Exploratory/research tasks without code changes
- ‚ùå Minor refactoring without functional changes
- ‚ùå Documentation-only fixes (only update CHANGELOG.md)
- ‚ùå Work in progress (wait until task complete)

#### Timing Guidelines
- **Immediately**: STATUS.md after task completion
- **Daily**: CHANGELOG.md with day's changes
- **Weekly**: PLANNING.md progress review
- **Phase-end**: Full documentation consistency check
