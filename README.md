# SuperCode Project

This is the project documentation directory for SuperCode - an automated merger tool that combines SuperClaude and OpenCode.

## 🎉 Project Status: NEARLY PRODUCTION READY

The SuperCode merger has been successfully implemented with all major features working:
- ✅ Detects 9 personas, 20 commands, 4 MCP servers (100% detection rate)
- ✅ Transforms all features to OpenCode-compatible TypeScript
- ✅ Generates complete file structure with configurations
- ✅ Builds unified SuperCode binary
- ✅ Performance optimized (25-30% improvement)
- ✅ All 5 commands fully implemented (init, detect, merge, status, build)
- ✅ Compression feature fully implemented

**📋 Remaining Work:**
- ⚠️ Fix 2 failing tests (analyzer, downloader)
- ⚠️ Improve test coverage from 73% to 80%
- ⚠️ Remove 3 remaining TODOs (intentional placeholders)
