# Initial Feasibility Analysis - Archive

> **Note**: This document contains the original feasibility analysis from January 9, 2025. For current implementation details, see [implementation-details.md](implementation-details.md).

## Executive Summary

The migration of SuperClaude features to OpenCode is feasible with an estimated timeline of 12-17 weeks for full feature parity.

### Key Findings

1. **Minimal Implementation (MVP)**: 2-3 weeks
   - Basic personas, slash commands, and UltraCompressed mode
   - Provides 60% of user value with 20% effort

2. **Full Feature Parity**: 12-17 weeks
   - All 9 personas, 18 commands, advanced features
   - Requires architectural extensions to OpenCode

3. **Technical Compatibility**: High
   - OpenCode's MCP support enables most SuperClaude features
   - Go's performance benefits for token compression
   - Existing tools (agent, write, edit) provide foundation

## Effort Breakdown

### Phase 1: Quick Wins (2-3 weeks)
- **Personas**: Extend config system
- **Slash Commands**: Create .md templates  
- **UltraCompressed Mode**: Text transformation engine

### Phase 2: Core Features (4-6 weeks)
- **Context7**: MCP server for docs
- **Sequential Thinking**: Multi-step reasoning
- **Advanced Commands**: Workflow engine

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (6-8 weeks)
- **Magic UI Builder**: Component generation
- **Research-First**: External API integration
- **Puppeteer Testing**: Browser automation
- **Full Config System**: YAML-based inheritance

## Architecture Insights

1. **MCP Integration**: OpenCode's existing MCP support is the key enabler
2. **Go Performance**: Ideal for token compression algorithms
3. **Bubble Tea TUI**: May need extensions for advanced UI features
4. **Config System**: Requires hierarchical YAML support

## Risk Assessment

- **Low Risk**: Personas, commands, compression (proven patterns)
- **Medium Risk**: MCP servers, sequential thinking (new integrations)
- **High Risk**: UI builder, browser automation (complex dependencies)
