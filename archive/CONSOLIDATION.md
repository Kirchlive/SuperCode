# Documentation Consolidation

*Date: 2025-07-10*

## Overview

Project documentation restructured for better generalization and maintainability. Reduced 14 files to 10 while preserving all information.

## Changes Made

### 1. Merged Files

#### **PLANNING.md** (NEW)
Consolidated from:
- `plan-supercode.md` - Implementation roadmap
- `development-strategy.md` - Development approach
- `implementation-plan-next-steps.md` - Immediate actions

**Benefits**: Eliminated ~70% duplication in timelines and task lists

#### **ARCHITECTURE.md** (NEW)
Consolidated from:
- `implementation-details.md` - Technical details
- `merger-architecture.md` - System architecture

**Benefits**: Removed ~60% overlap in architecture descriptions

#### **FEATURE-MAPPING.md** (NEW)
Consolidated from:
- `feature-mapping.md` - Feature transformations
- `feature-mapping-detailed.md` - Detailed mappings

**Benefits**: Eliminated ~80% duplication

### 2. Renamed Files

| Old Name | New Name | Reason |
|----------|----------|---------|
| `implementation-status.md` | `STATUS.md` | More generic, clearer purpose |
| `development-log.md` | `CHANGELOG.md` | Industry standard naming |
| `automation-setup.md` | `SETUP.md` | Simpler, more universal |
| `repository-analysis.md` | `ANALYSIS.md` | Shorter, clearer |
| `migration-visualization.md.mermaid` | `DIAGRAM.md.mermaid` | Consistent naming |

### 3. Archived Files

Moved to `archive/` directory:
- `ARCHIVE-initial-analysis.md`
- All original files that were merged

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Reduced Redundancy**: 60-80% less duplicate content
2. **Better Navigation**: Clearer file purposes and organization
3. **Easier Maintenance**: Updates needed in fewer places
4. **Generalized Language**: More suitable for any merger project
5. **Preserved Information**: All content maintained, nothing lost

## Usage Guidelines

- **For Planning**: See PLANNING.md for roadmap and next steps
- **For Technical Details**: See ARCHITECTURE.md for system design
- **For Implementation**: See FEATURE-MAPPING.md for transformation rules
- **For Progress**: See STATUS.md for current state
- **For History**: See CHANGELOG.md for development timeline

## Migration Notes

All links in README.md and CLAUDE.md have been updated. The archive directory contains all original files if reference is needed.
