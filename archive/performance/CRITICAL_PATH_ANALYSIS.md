## Critical Path Components

### 1. Repository Download (60s) - **CRITICAL**
- **Impact**: 29% of total time
- **Parallelizable**: YES
- **Expected Improvement**: 30s (50% reduction)

### 2. Feature Detection (20s) - **CRITICAL**  
- **Impact**: 10% of total time
- **Parallelizable**: YES
- **Expected Improvement**: 5s (75% reduction)

### 3. Transformation (10s) - **MODERATE**
- **Impact**: 5% of total time
- **Parallelizable**: YES
- **Expected Improvement**: 3s (70% reduction)

### 4. Build Process (120s) - **ALREADY OPTIMIZED**
- **Impact**: 57% of total time
- **Parallelizable**: Limited (Go/TS compilation)
- **Expected Improvement**: None

## Amdahl's Law Application

Total speedup = 1 / ((1-P) + P/S)

Where:
- P = Parallelizable portion (43% = downloads + detection + transform)
- S = Speedup factor (average 2.5x)

**Maximum theoretical speedup**: 1.3x (25% improvement)

## Implementation Priority Matrix

```
Impact vs Effort:
         High Impact
              |
    [1]       |      [3]
 Downloads    |    Cache
              |
Easy ---------|--------- Hard
              |
    [2]       |      [4]
 Detection    |   Algorithms
              |
         Low Impact
```

1. **Parallel Downloads** - High impact, Easy
2. **Parallel Detection** - Medium impact, Easy
3. **Shared Cache** - High impact, Medium
4. **Algorithm Fixes** - Low impact, Hard

## Resource Utilization

### Current
- CPU: 20-30% (mostly single-threaded)
- Memory: 100-200MB
- Disk I/O: Sequential, inefficient
- Network: Sequential downloads

### Optimized
- CPU: 60-80% (parallel execution)
- Memory: 150-250MB (with caching)
- Disk I/O: Cached, single-pass
- Network: Parallel downloads

## Bottleneck Removal Strategy

### Phase 1: Network I/O (Day 1)
- Parallelize git operations
- Expected: 30s saved

### Phase 2: CPU Utilization (Day 2)
- Parallelize detection algorithms
- Expected: 15s saved

### Phase 3: Disk I/O (Day 3)
- Implement caching layer
- Expected: 5s saved

### Total Expected Improvement
- Current: 210s
- Optimized: 158s
- **Improvement: 52s (25%)**

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk
- Parallel downloads (isolated operations)
- Regex caching (simple change)

### Medium Risk
- Parallel detection (needs mutex for shared state)
- Shared cache (thread safety required)

### High Risk
- Algorithm changes (could affect correctness)
- Memory optimizations (could cause leaks)

## Monitoring Points

Add timing logs at:
1. Start/end of each download
2. Start/end of each detector
3. Cache hit/miss rates
4. Memory allocation stats
5. Goroutine counts

## Quick Wins (< 1 hour each)

1. Add progress indicators
2. Cache compiled regexes
3. Pre-allocate slices with capacity
4. Use strings.Builder for concatenation
5. Add --parallel flag for testing
