# Utility Commands Test Suite

This directory contains comprehensive test-driven development (TDD) tests for the SuperClaude utility commands implementation.

## Test Structure

### Individual Command Tests
- `help.test.ts` - Context-aware help system with fuzzy search and command suggestions
- `search.test.ts` - Advanced code search with semantic understanding and filtering
- `document-enhanced.test.ts` - Enhanced documentation generation with persona integration
- `spawn.test.ts` - Sub-agent orchestration and complex task coordination

### Integration Tests
- `integration.test.ts` - Cross-command compatibility and system integration validation

## Test Philosophy

These tests follow Test-Driven Development principles:

1. **Tests Written First** - All tests were written before implementation to define expected behavior
2. **Comprehensive Coverage** - Tests cover normal usage, edge cases, error handling, and performance
3. **Behavior Specification** - Tests serve as executable specifications for command functionality
4. **Integration Validation** - Tests ensure commands work together as a cohesive system

## Command Implementations

### /help Command
- **File**: `../help.ts`
- **Features**: Context-aware help, fuzzy search, persona integration
- **Tests**: General help, command-specific help, search functionality, persona enhancements

### /search Command  
- **File**: `../search.ts`
- **Features**: File/content search, semantic understanding, advanced filtering
- **Tests**: Query validation, search types, semantic search, persona adaptation

### /document Command (Enhanced)
- **File**: `../document.ts` 
- **Features**: Comprehensive documentation generation, templates, persona integration
- **Tests**: Code analysis, multiple doc types, persona enhancements, auto-features

### /spawn Command
- **File**: `../spawn.ts`
- **Features**: Sub-agent orchestration, task breakdown, progress monitoring
- **Tests**: Task parsing, dependency validation, execution strategies, monitoring

## Running Tests

```bash
# Run all utility command tests
bun test src/commands/__tests__/

# Run specific command tests
bun test src/commands/__tests__/help.test.ts
bun test src/commands/__tests__/search.test.ts
bun test src/commands/__tests__/document-enhanced.test.ts
bun test src/commands/__tests__/spawn.test.ts

# Run integration tests
bun test src/commands/__tests__/integration.test.ts
```

## Test Categories

### 1. Basic Functionality Tests
- Command argument validation
- Core feature implementation
- Output formatting
- Error handling

### 2. Persona Integration Tests
- Architect persona enhancements
- Developer persona adaptations
- Scribe persona improvements
- Cross-persona consistency

### 3. Performance Tests
- Execution time requirements
- Concurrent execution handling
- Large dataset processing
- Memory usage validation

### 4. Integration Tests
- Command metadata compatibility
- Cross-command functionality
- Tool integration validation
- Error handling consistency

### 5. Edge Case Tests
- Invalid input handling
- Resource constraint scenarios
- Network/filesystem failures
- Concurrent access patterns

## Mock Systems

The tests use sophisticated mock systems to simulate:

- **Help System**: Command registry, fuzzy search, personalized help
- **Search Engines**: File search, content search, semantic search, indexing
- **Documentation Engines**: Code analysis, template processing, persona enhancements
- **Orchestration System**: Task breakdown, agent coordination, progress monitoring
- **File System**: File operations, metadata access, directory traversal
- **Validation System**: Quality checks, integration validation, error recovery

## Test Data and Fixtures

Tests use realistic mock data representing:
- Complex codebases with multiple file types
- Authentication system implementations
- Documentation generation scenarios
- Multi-phase project development tasks

## Expected Behavior

### Command Success Criteria
- All commands complete within specified time limits
- Error handling provides actionable feedback
- Output formats are consistent and valid
- Persona integration enhances functionality appropriately

### Integration Success Criteria
- Commands work together seamlessly
- Shared metadata is consistent across the system
- Tool usage matches declared capabilities
- Performance scales appropriately with complexity

## Implementation Notes

The tests are designed to:

1. **Drive Implementation** - Each test defines specific behavior that must be implemented
2. **Prevent Regression** - Comprehensive test coverage prevents breaking changes
3. **Document Behavior** - Tests serve as living documentation of command functionality
4. **Enable Refactoring** - Solid test foundation allows safe code improvements

## Future Enhancements

The test suite is designed to support:
- Additional command implementations
- Extended persona types
- New output formats
- Enhanced integration patterns
- Performance optimization validation

## Command Compatibility

All utility commands are designed to be compatible with:
- **SuperClaude Command Framework** - Follows established patterns
- **External Metadata** - Matches `external/superclaude` specifications
- **Tool Integration** - Uses declared tool capabilities appropriately
- **Persona System** - Supports consistent persona enhancements

This test-driven approach ensures high-quality, reliable command implementations that integrate seamlessly with the broader SuperClaude ecosystem.
